We are building an intelligent agent to help people understand the purpose and value of interactive intelligence and cognitive computing. This conversational agent will be able to teach concepts, find online courses, share recent news, and find jobs in this exciting sub-field of artificial intelligence.  There are two primary systems that compose the agent. The first is a knowledge-base system composed of subsystems that acquire, store, and retrieve knowledge. The second is the conversational system that allows the agent to interact with people and reason over its knowledge. The purpose of the knowledge-base (KB) is to store concepts, courses, news articles, and jobs as frames in a semantic network. This knowledge-base provides the foundation for case-based reasoning. The conversational system is surfaced as a chat bot that will be supported on several channels, including Skype, Facebook, and the web.
