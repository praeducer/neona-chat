# Neona
Neona is a chat bot that helps people understand artificial intelligence: http://www.neona.chat/. People interacting with her will learn about the topics students of AI study. This post explains how she works in detail: http://blog.paulprae.com/neona-a-conversational-agent-that-teaches-ai-2/ 

Her conversational user interface design, technical architecture, and code will also be used for live lessons and demos about how to build bots: https://www.slideshare.net/PaulPrae/azure-as-a-chatbot-service-from-purpose-to-production-with-a-cloud-bot-architecture  

What's next for Neona? In the future, she will be used by students to find courses and jobs in the field of AI. From the perspective of universities and employers, she will also be used as a teaching assistant and a recruiting tool.
